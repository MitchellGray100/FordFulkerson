JavaFX Ford-Fulkerson Calculator. Inspired by CS 4820. <br>

As a personal project, I created a representation of a Ford-Fulkerson Calculator in Java using JavaFX.
The calculator lets the user place nodes and connect each node with edges. The nodes automatically number themselves from s->1->2->n->t.
The capacities of every edge can be changed. Nodes and Edges can be removed. Nodes automatically decrement, if needed, to keep the numbered
numbered structured. Edges automatically remove themselves from removed nodes. All edges and capacities can be seen by clicking on Nodes.
The left panel is scrollable incase there is a large quantity of edges coming out of a node. Max Flow can be checked with the push of a button.
